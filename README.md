# PLDevTable
Some notes:

Inactive means that the repository hasn't been committed to in around a a year or is archived. A question mark means I cannot figure some given thing out with confidence. No Implementation means that there is not an official implementation yet. Some author names are Discord usernames, I apologize!

If I get something wrong you can open up a GH issue (do not DM me on Discord about this, please) and I'll get right to it. <3

Note on ASC: I've seen a working implementation floating around before, but I cannot remember the details of it.
